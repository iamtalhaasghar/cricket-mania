Semester Project for the course, "Programming Fundamentals in Cpp"

# Cricket Mania
In this project, we have developed an algorithm in Cpp for calculating "Target Score" using "Duckworth Lewis Stern Methodology" in scenarios in which innings have to be reduced due to rain or someother unforeseen circumstance.

# Problem Statement
Duck Worth lewis stern calculator is used to calculate the revised target when a cricket match is interrupted due to extreme weather conditions.
Sometimes in cricket a match is delayed due to bad or extreme weather conditions . in such case a proper method is required to calculate or determine the new target for the team batting at second postion or the team chasing the target for this ICC introduces a method named as **DUCKWORTH LEWIS STERN** formula to calculate the loss and determine the new target for the second team to chase it.
  - Team 1 means team which is batting first and team 2 means team batting at second order
  - suspension in play means interruption in match

  1. Case 1 - Interruption by weather / Suspension during Team 1’s innings
  2. Case 2 - Delay to start of Team 2’s innings
  3. Case 3 - Suspension during Team 2’s innings
  4. Case 4 - Multiple suspensions and abandonment
  5. Case 5 - Suspension and termination of Team 1’s innings mid-over and delay to Team 2’s innings
